The instruction of the game:
The game aims to creating good balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement, according to a strategy built within the group.

Game rules:
In first year the game is played with same given orders for all groups.
After the completion of the first year round, every group decides how many orders to handle each year. Then the orders are given by turns. After second year round The orders are given by turns before each year. Here we use an interactive algorithm which tell us what is the order to choose, according to a dynamic list.




Since our strategy was mass production, then we decided to choose order with the highest unit price, so the difference from the net income and prodution cost would be large.
